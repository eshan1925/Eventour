# Eventour
The one and only event management system.

## Motivation
As technology advances, we often aim for newer and better approaches for solving problems leaving behind the orthodox methods. Though, most of the things have been brought to our 6.5 inch screen, there's one thing which we feel, still needs improvisation- **The Event Management System**. The need arises mainly when one need to organise an event/ceremony outside our hometown. So instead of hustling around, worrying for contact details of best DJ, decorators around the city one just need to hop-on to our app and book his requirements for the occassion. With this motivation we have built this one stop app for all your occassion needs.
